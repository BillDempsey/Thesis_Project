# Thesis_Project
My Master's Thesis project was titled "An Investigation into the Potential of Embedded Strain Sensors for Force Monitoring in Grinding Wheels".  

## Overview

This project investigates the integration of smart tooling into grinding processes, leveraging embedded sensors to monitor grinding forces in real time. The project served to evaluate if such sensor solutions would have the physical capabilities to measure such dyanmics.

## Motivation

Grinding is a widely used material removal process, but it often suffers from inefficiencies due to conservative parameter settings aimed at avoiding workpiece damage. Smart tooling, particularly with embedded strain sensors, offers a promising solution to this issue by providing real-time feedback on tool-workpiece interactions.

## Methodology

- A combined **experimental** and **Finite Element (FE) simulation** approach was used to assess sensor feasibility.
- Grinding wheel geometry was simplified and subjected to static load cases.
- Strain responses to **out-of-plane (axial)** and **in-plane (tangential/normal)** forces were evaluated.

## Findings

- **Bending strain** from out-of-plane forces is significant and detectable by SAW and MR sensors.
- **Shear strain** from in-plane forces is minimal, making these forces difficult to measure using wheel-embedded sensors.
- Modified wheel designs (e.g., thinned or slotted) improved strain responsiveness but still favored bending over shear.
- **SAW sensors** are optimal for detecting axial forces; MR sensors also show some potential.

## Conclusion

- Embedded strain sensors are well-suited for detecting out-of-plane grinding forces.
- In-plane forces are less detectable using current wheel-embedded sensor configurations.
- Future work should explore embedding sensors in the **grinding wheel shaft** to enable detection of tangential and normal forces.
